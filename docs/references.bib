	abstract = {This study estimates empirically derived guidelines for effect size interpretation for research in social psychology overall and sub-disciplines within social psychology, based on analysis of the true distributions of the two types of effect size measures widely used in social psychology (correlation coefficient and standardized mean differences). Analysis of empirically derived distributions of 12,170 correlation coefficients and 6,447 Cohen's d statistics extracted from studies included in 134 published meta-analyses revealed that the 25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles corresponded to correlation coefficient values of 0.12, 0.24, and 0.41 and to Cohen's d values of 0.15, 0.36, and 0.65 respectively. The analysis suggests that the widely used Cohen's guidelines tend to overestimate medium and large effect sizes. Empirically derived effect size distributions in social psychology overall and its sub-disciplines can be used both for effect size interpretation and for sample size planning when other information about effect size is not available.},

	abstract = {The OPTIMAL theory of motor learning predicts enhanced expectancies facilitate learning. This meta-analysis investigated this prediction by quantifying effect sizes from studies manipulating feedback after good trials, comparative feedback, perceived task difficulty, conceptions of ability, self-modeling, or extrinsic rewards, and assessing learning. After searching databases, 48 studies met inclusion criteria for quantitative analysis. Fifty-six effect sizes were calculated from performance differences between enhanced expectancies and neutral/diminished expectancies groups at delayed retention tests. Results revealed a Hedges’ g = 0.54 (95\% CI [0.38, 0.69]) that may be overestimated due to small-study effects and underpowered studies. Moderator analyses revealed feedback after good trials, comparative feedback, perceived task difficulty, and conceptions of ability manipulations significantly improved learning. Few studies used other manipulations, precluding reliable estimates of their effects. Further, significant effects of enhanced expectancies were shown for children/adolescents, young adults, and older adults. Few studies examined special populations, preventing a reliable effect estimate. Finally, the effect of enhanced expectancies on learning was not affected by type of comparison group (neutral/diminished expectancies). Findings suggest enhanced expectancies may facilitate motor learning, consistent with OPTIMAL theory, but pre-registered/registered reports and more powerful studies should be conducted to confirm the effect and estimate its size more accurately.},
