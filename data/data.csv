Similarities and differences between the subjects will be determined and additionally the coordination between eye movement and head movement will be scrutinized.

Furthermore, to stabilize the gaze a strong coordination between the eye movement and head movement when initiating and performing the twisting somersault is expected

extension angles and the onsets of fixation in each back full will be captured. Gymnasts of a lower performance class are hypothesized
to reveal both sooner onset times of their fixation and earlier timestamps of maximum head angles because they need orientation as
early as possible (Natrup et al., 2020). Thirdly, in addition to the timestamps, the maximum absolute angle values of the axial head
rotation and head extension will be evaluated. It is hypothesized that experienced and higher-level gymnasts will show smaller maximum angle values because the international rules demand a “good form and execution” in a twisting somersault, i.e. the head and spine should be in a straight line (FIG, 2017; Natrup et al., 2020).

We hypothesized that older adults that exhibit a loss of complexity in their gait patterns will exhibit patterns similar to those commonly observed in healthy young adults when they walk to a variable fractal-like visual stimulus. Additionally, we also aimed to investigate if such effects would persist after the removal of the stimulus. Based on the results from Rhea et al. (2014) in healthy young adults and from Hove et al. (2012) in Parkinson's Disease patients, we hypothesized that after the removal of the variable fractal-like visual stimulus, older adults will be able to maintain the above hypothesized positive effects. ","Our hypothesis that older adults who
exhibit a loss of complexity in their gait patterns would have an increase in gait complexity when walking to a fractal-like stimulus was verified. This was observed through the significant increase of the parameter under study, fractal scaling, from 0.71 to 0.85 in the fractal-like stimulus. We have also observed that walking to an invariant stimulus did not affect gait complexity of older adults.
Additionally, we aimed to investigate potential retention effects after the stimulus was turned off. Our hypothesis that older adults would maintain their higher levels of gait complexity generated by the fractal-like stimulus even after this stimulus will be turned off, was also verified.

1761,Haddad 2019,Developmental Changes in Postural Stability During the Performance of a Precision Manual Task,Julie Hubley,Yes,No,No,"Firstly, we hypothesized that postural TtC would be shorter in the younger children compared with the older children and adults. This hypothesis predicts that young children will operate closer to their stability boundaries when performing a standing manual task (a situation that could potentially cause a postural instability or impede
performance of the manual task). Secondly, we hypothesized that an increase in TtC (across all age groups) would be observed as the precision demands of the task increased. An increase in TtC would indicate that all age groups adopt a more stable posture when needed to successfully complete the supra-postural manual task.
Thirdly, we hypothesized that a decrease in TtC would be observed as the postural demands of the task increased. A decrease in TtC would indicate that participants were less stable when leaning forward to complete the task. Finally, we hypothesized that there would be an interaction between age and the manipulated constraints.
Specifically, we predicted that adults would be able to adopt a longer TtC (exhibit increased postural stability) compared with children when performing the more difficult manual fitting task.","Results indicated systematic age effects in which TtC was shortest in the 7-year-olds, increased in the 10-year-olds, and was longest in the adults. Across all age levels, TtC was longer when performing a precision fit compared with a non-precision fit and when fitting at a near target compared with fitting at a far target.

task, suggesting that posture became increasingly stable as the hand approached the opening. The ability to modulate postural TtC during the course of the fitting trial was most pronounced in adults as compared with both groups of children. ",Yes,17,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1730,Carter 2019,Motor Skill Retention Is Modulated by Strategy Choice During Self-Controlled Knowledge of Results Schedules,Aaron Schwarz,Yes,No,No," On the basis of past research (Laughlin et 
al., 2015; Patterson & Carter, 2010), we expected that a dominant strategy would 
be requesting KR after trials that were perceived as good by the learner. We also 
expected to see a shift in the dominant strategy used between the two halves of 
practice because it has been shown that participants in a self-controlled KR group 
adopt different strategies on the basis of their stage in practice (e.g., Carter & Pat
-
terson, 2012). Similar to Laughlin et al. (2015), we also expected that the use of 
open-ended questions would reveal strategies for requesting KR that have yet to 
surface in previous self-controlled KR experiments.","Similar to Laughlin et al. (2015), the use of open-ended questions in the present 
experiment also identified new strategies for requesting KR such as using KR to 
“establish a baseline understanding,” to “evaluate a change in (motor) strategy,” 
and also to “schedule KR based on trial” within a block, thus extending our cur
-
rent understanding of why participants choose KR during practice. We also noted 
a shift in the dominant self-reported strategy as a function of practice half, which 
is consistent with the findings of Carter and Patterson (2012).",Yes,8,,,,,,No,No,"The primary question of interest in Phase 2 was whether using the dominant KR 
strategy of a given practice half as identified in Phase 1 was associated with supe
-
rior motor learning compared with not using the dominant strategy (i.e., using one 
of the other four identified strategies) and not being able to use any strategy (i.e., 
yoked group).","The analysis revealed that motor learning, as measured using a delayed no-KR 
retention test, was differentially influenced by not only the specific KR strategy 
adopted by the learner but also the timing of when a particular KR strategy was 
implemented.",Yes,8,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
